This Is Our Team Project Idea

## Motivation
---
>  During these difficult times, people want to be help their community, but they're not sure how, so many are asking:

> *How can I be involved in social activism?*

> Our goal is to match users with an organization based on their interest to encourage social activism. This is help people living in Seattle start the process of looking for social activism organization locally and nationally.

## What we created
---
> We created a website that takes the user through a short quiz to gage their interest in terms of social activism involvement and their interests. 

> Some group initiatives are:
  * BLM
  * Youth
  * Incarceration Reform
  * Female Empowerment
  * Small Business Relief
  * Animals
  
 > We hope to get people more involved in their communities by donating or volunteering their time. This web-app would be a great platform for users to discover new initiatives.
